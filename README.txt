System for my 3rd year dissertation, consists of a Naive OpenGL engine, an AZDO OpenGL engine, and a Vulkan engine.
Each engine has 5 renderers which are used as experiments for later evaluation, the renderer that will run is controlled
by preprocessor definitions in System.cpp (naive and AZDO) and RenderPass.cpp (Vulkan).

Requirements:

OpenGL 4.6 for AZDO sparse textures
Vulkan SDK 1.1
Vulkan graphics and compute queues must be the same queue
A discrete GPU
